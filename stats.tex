a. In order to find the correlation coefficient between �� and ��, we first need to calculate the means and variances of �� and ��. We have that

$$\mu_X = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{y} 2x , dx , dy = \frac{1}{3}$$

and

$$\mu_Y = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{y} 2y , dx , dy = \frac{1}{2}.$$

The variances of �� and �� are given by

$$\sigma_X^2 = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{y} (x - \mu_X)^2 , dx , dy = \frac{1}{15}$$

and

$$\sigma_Y^2 = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{y} (y - \mu_Y)^2 , dx , dy = \frac{1}{12}.$$

We can then calculate the covariance of �� and �� as

$$\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{y} (x - \mu_X)(y - \mu_Y) , dx , dy = \frac{1}{20}.$$

The correlation coefficient between �� and �� is then given by

$$\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y} = \frac{\frac{1}{20}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{15}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{12}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}.$$

Therefore, the correlation coefficient between �� and �� is $\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$.

b. The expected value of �� given that �� = �� is given by

$$\mathbb{E}[X | Y = y] = \int_{0}^{y} 2x , dx = \frac{y^2}{2}.$$

Similarly, the expected value of �� given that �� = �� is given by

$$\mathbb{E}[Y | X = x] = \int_{x}^{1} 2y , dy = 2 - 2x.$$

The results make sense intuitively since the expected value of �� given �� = �� is a function of ��, which makes sense since the value of �� determines the range of possible values of ��. Similarly, the expected value of �� given �� = �� is a function of ��, since the value of �� determines the range of possible values of ��.

c. The probability density function of the random variable ��[��|��] is given by

$$f_{\mathbb{E}[X | Y]}(z) = \int_{0}^{1}
